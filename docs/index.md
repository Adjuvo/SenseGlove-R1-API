# What is this?
This is the python API to interface with Rembrandt, an active force feedback glove with precise position tracking made for telerobotics by SenseGlove. With this API you can retrieve tracking data in many formats, and control the active force feedback pulling on the fingers in the glove. 

> ⚠️ **In Development - Please give your feedback!**
>
> Both the product and the API are still under development and are subject to change. If you require certain functionality from the API, we would be happy to receive your feedback!


#### ROS vs ROS2 support

ROS2 is supported. Please let us know if your project requires ROS1. Our current API also supports ROS1, requiring **python 3.8.x**.
